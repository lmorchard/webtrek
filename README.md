    * If the planets are aligned, this server might be up.

This is my attempt to learn how to make a game out of node.js, canvas,
websockets, and JavaScript. It might even end up being fun!

## Requirements

* Linux or Mac OS X
* A modern web browser that's not from Microsoft
* node.js
* npm
    * connect
    * express
    * ejs
    * socket.io
    * nodeunit

## Running a server

* `./bin/server.js`
* <http://localhost:3000>

## Running tests

* `nodeunit test`

## Credits

* Inspiration and generous hunks of code stolen from [wpilot][]
    * Why not just hack on [wpilot][]? I wanted to organize things differently,
        and learn by building from a (mostly) clean slate.
